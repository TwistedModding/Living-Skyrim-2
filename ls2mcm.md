Finally:  

Open your Magic menu and select "Reflect..." from the powers menu. Press your Shout key (usually Z) to activate it. Select whatever background/bonus you like or whatever fits with your character/build.

**Important!: The following mods can only be configured after you have selected your Alternate Start and loaded into the gameworld or have escaped the Abandoned Prison. Do not attempt to configure these until you have done so!**

* iEquip
* You can configure iEquip how you want, but I recommend the following.
  * General settings
    * iEquip On: Enabled
    * Now exit the menu and wait for the widget to appear.
  * Queue Options
    * Item caching and blacklisting
      * Blacklist Manually Removed Items: Enabled
  * Misc UI Options
    * Enable Widget Fadeout: Enabled
    * Fadeout Delay: 5
    * Fadeout Speed: Fast

  * Genesis Settings
    * Mod is Active: Enabled
    * Max Number of Dungeon Spawns: 20
    * Max Number of Surface Spawns: 0

    * Randomize Number of Dungeon Spawns: Enabled
    * Allow Spawning at Player: Disabled
    * Spawn if Other Hostiles Near: Disabled
    * Dispose of the book Genesis Options from your inventory however you choose, this mod's configuration is handled by MCM and the book does nothing. It's a holdover from the previous version of Genesis by the mod author and is redundant.

* Hunterborn 
  - Features
    - Click Start Hunterborn, then exit the MCM and wait for the "Hunterborn started!" message to appear in the top left.
  - Compatibility
    - Compatibility with Hunting in Skyrim: Enabled

**Save your game after completing MCM setup, I promise you do not want to have to do this process more than once.**
